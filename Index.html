    <h1>Saylani Welfare</h1>
    We provide a platform for organized and intelligent giving for donors of all levels – individuals, corporations, aid agencies and other non-profit organizations – with the goal of maximizing the impact and effectiveness of their donations. In addition to channeling donations, i-Care works with its partner organizations to improve their financial controls, governance and program delivery. By the grace of the Almighty, Al-Mustafa Welfare Society has gained recognition in the fields of social and welfare activities throughout Pakistan and also at international level. We believe that the name of Al-Mustafa and sincere devotion and efforts of our donors, workers and volunteers are the main factors of our success. Our main focus is in the fields of health, education and social services for the low-income group of our society.

    Besides routine welfare activities, Al-Mustafa has contributed a lot during national disasters like earthquake 2005, floods 2010, 2011 and 2012.
    
    To continue all such activates and broaden the spectrum of our services for the needy people, Al-Mustafa needs your support. We invite you to visit any of our centers yourself or send your representative for being aware of the tireless devotion of our workers.
    
    You can view our work on our website as well and decide yourself that in which field you are interested to help people. May the Almighty help and guide us.    </p>
